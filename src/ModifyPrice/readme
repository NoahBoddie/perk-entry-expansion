1D6660 is the address I need in order to be able to handle modify price.
Note there are some uses other than where it will load prices, but these prices are only used for skill advancing 
 rather than actually calculating price.

 Correction, 1D66E0 is the price handling function I think. 890E70+1F1 specifically

2F4BED4 is the ref handle for the actor in question for the thing. The inventory can be searched via the data handler.
 And the player is around obviously

 Use this to get who the owner is. I'll be a little jank, use some threads ids to make it safe
 8527B0+66


 171590+149 will have to be used to get the accurate chest used for the barter menu. nvm, I can get it from the spot.
