8538A0+61 for SE is where these checks are handled. Follow what they assign to to see if we could handle this

Seems like it's stored in some kind of struct. I have no idea how deep it goes. But it seems to be

reference
bool 0x08 0 if player, 1 if merchant
bool BypassStolen
bool BypassKeyword

855B60 seems to be the function to pick at.
5DA730 specifically, if it's not inlined that is. 855B60+4F is the spot.
It's around the reset vendor chest reset, so bare that in mind.

VendorOverride is the keyword, VendorOverrideStolen and VendorOverrideType are specific branches to address one specific
 or the other. Only activates when not normally allowed.


 AE:892B00+21C will have to be used as an AE exclusive hook
 //Scratch, 892B00+277 might work just as well. It'll go through an extra bit but no harm I say.


 Accounting for ownership will be thus, the first arg, merchant chest as target, merchant as subject.
 Second arg, the owner as first argument, nothing as the second. (this can make it so you can sell things if stolen from a particular faction or person).
 To swing the latter, I'll need to be able to make an actor standin as well, to run on factions.
